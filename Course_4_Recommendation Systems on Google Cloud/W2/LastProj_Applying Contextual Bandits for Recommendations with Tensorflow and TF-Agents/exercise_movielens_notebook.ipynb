    "Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) is a Machine Learning framework in which an agent has to select actions (arms) in order to maximize its cumulative reward in the long term. In each round, the agent receives some information about the current state (context), then it chooses an action based on this information and the experience gathered in previous rounds. At the end of each round, the agent receives the reward assiociated with the chosen action.\n",

    "   1. [NeuralEpsilonGreedyAgent](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-epsilon-greedy-algorithm-for-reinforcement-learning-5fe6f96dc870): The neural episilon greed algorithm makes a value estimate for all the arms, and then chooses the best arm with the probaility (1-episilon) and any of the random arms with a probability of epsilon. this balances the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and epsilon is set to a small value like 10%. Example: In this example we have seven arms: one of each of the classes, and if we set episilon to say 10%, then 90% of the times the agent will choose the arm with the highest value estimate ( expplotiing the one most likely to be the predicted class) and 10% of the time it will choose a random arm from all of the 7 arms( thus exploring the other possibilities). Refer [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/api_docs/python/tf_agents/bandits/agents/neural_epsilon_greedy_agent/NeuralEpsilonGreedyAgent) for more information of the tensorflow agents version of the same.\n",

Ther agen trains this policy, and the policy adds the exploration-exploitation component on top of this, and also chooses the action. In this example we will use a Deep Q Network as our value function, and we use the epsilon greedy on topof this to select the actions. In this case the action space would be 20 for 20 movies, the contextual state vector would be the dense user vector from the matrix decomposition. In applied situations, a dictionary mapping could be made from a user id to its dense representation to make it more convinient for the end user.\n",

    "## 5. Initialize & configure the Replay Buffer\n",
    "Reinforcement learning algorithms use replay buffers to store trajectories of experience when executing a policy in an environment. During training, replay buffers are queried for a subset of the trajectories (either a sequential subset or a sample) to \"replay\" the agent's experience. Sampling from the replay buffer facilitate data re-use and breaks harmful co-relation between sequential data in RL, although in contextual bandits this isn't absolutely required but still helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The replay buffer exposes several functions which allow you to manipulate the replay buffer in several ways. Read more on them [here] (https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/5_replay_buffers_tutorial)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo we would be using the TFUniformReplayBuffer for which we need to initialize the buffer spec with the spec of the trajectory of the agent's policy, a chosen batch size( number of trajectories to store), and the maximum length of the trajectory. ( this is the amount of sequential time steps which will be considered as one data point). so a batch of 3 with 2 time steps each would result in a tensor of shape (3,2). Since unlike regular RL problems, Contextual bandits have only one time step we can keep max_length =1, however since this tutorial is to enable you for RL problems as well, let set it to 2. Do not worry, any contextual bandit agent will internally\n",
    "split the time steps inside each data point such that the effective batch size ends up being (6,1). "
