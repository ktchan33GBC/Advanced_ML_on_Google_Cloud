# Advanced_ML_on_Google_Cloud
Notes and exercises for [Advanced Machine Learning on Google Cloud](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp) Offered by Google Cloud  on Coursera.

## About
This 5-course specialization focuses on advanced machine learning topics using Google Cloud Platform where you will get hands-on experience optimizing, deploying, and scaling production ML models of various types in hands-on labs. 

This specialization picks up where “Machine Learning on GCP” left off and teaches you how to build scalable, accurate, and production-ready models for structured data, image data, time-series, and natural language text. It ends with a course on building recommendation systems.
